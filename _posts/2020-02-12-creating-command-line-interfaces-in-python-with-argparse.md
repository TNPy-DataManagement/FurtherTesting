If you have ever written a script in Python you surely know the importance of having a good command-line interface for your application.

And this is why today I\'m posting here a link to another post I wrote for <em>Real Python</em> on this topic some months ago.

<strong><a href="https://www.realpython.com">Real Python</a></strong> is one of the most important resources on the web about Python and Iâ€™m really proud to be part of that community full of brilliant people that share a common passion for this incredible programming language.
